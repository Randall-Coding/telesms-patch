# TeleSMS

TeleSMS is a library for sending and receiving SMS messages with emails.
It uses carrier-provided email-to-sms gateways to send and receive messages.
To see a list of gateways, visit https://web.archive.org/web/20130906122931/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways.

The purpose of this library is to encapsulate the code for sending and receiving 
email-to-sms messages since there are many edge cases. The goal is to maintain
the configuration and parsers to reduce the number of failed messages.
